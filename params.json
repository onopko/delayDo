{"name":"delayDo","tagline":"","body":"delayDo is a tiny jQuery plugin. It enables you to create a specific timer which contains some functions as a queue and can resume it later.\r\n\r\nAnd also delayDo is friendly for modern browsers. Its delay method uses requestAnimationFrame() and Performance.now() instead of setTimeout() and Date.now().\r\n\t\r\n## Usage\r\n\r\n1. Include jQuery:\r\n\r\n\t```html\r\n\t<script src=\"http://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/2.0.0/jquery.min.js\"></script>\r\n\t```\r\n\r\n2. Include plugin's code:\r\n\r\n\t```html\r\n\t<script src=\"dist/delayDo.min.js\"></script>\r\n\t```\r\n\r\n3. Create a timer (just name specific timer id) and add functions to its queue:\r\n\r\n\t```javascript\r\n\t$.delayDo('timerId', function () {\r\n\t\t// do something.\r\n\t});\r\n\t```\r\n\r\n4. Resume the timer. It calls a function from the queue one by one at regular intervals:\r\n\r\n\t```javascript\r\n\t$.delayDo.resume({\r\n\t\ttimerId: 'timerId',\r\n\t\tinterval: 200,\r\n\t\tcomplete: function () {\r\n\t\t\t// do something.\r\n\t\t}\r\n\t});\r\n\t```\r\n\r\n## Contributing\r\n\r\nCheck [CONTRIBUTING.md](https://github.com/onopko/delayDo/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md) for more information.\r\n\r\n## History\r\n\r\nCheck [Releases](https://github.com/onopko/delayDo/releases) for detailed changelog.\r\n\r\n## License\r\n\r\nThe MIT License ([MIT](http://www.opensource.org/licenses/mit-license.php))\r\n\r\nCopyright © 2015 Takehiko Ono <me@onotakehiko.com>\r\n\r\nPermission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a copy of this software and associated documentation files (the “Software”), to deal in the Software without restriction, including without limitation the rights to use, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sell copies of the Software, and to permit persons to whom the Software is furnished to do so, subject to the following conditions:\r\n\r\nThe above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be included in all copies or substantial portions of the Software.\r\n\r\nTHE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED “AS IS”, WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT.
